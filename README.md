# FlightDelayPrediction

The objective of this project was to develop a ML model for forecasting flight delays using the Airline On-Time Performance Data dataset from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The dataset consisted of information on domestic flights in the United States. Data cleaning and exploration were conducted to identify the most effective model for predicting flight delays. The results were compared across multiple machine learning models to determine the highest level of predictive accuracy. The project aimed to determine the likelihood of flights being "on-time," ultimately providing valuable insights for airline companies and passengers alike. All sources were properly cited and technical terms were used appropriately throughout the project.
